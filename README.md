# Smartphone-Controlled Robotic Vacuum Cleaner using Arduino Embedded Platform

This project involves the creation of a robotic vacuum cleaner that can be controlled via a smartphone using an Arduino-embedded platform. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors, motors, a vacuum cleaning mechanism, and a pump to perform various tasks based on user input from a connected smartphone.

## Features
- **Smartphone Control:** The robotic vacuum cleaner can be controlled wirelessly through user commands sent from a connected smartphone. The commands include forward movement, backward movement, left and right turns, as well as activation and deactivation of the vacuum cleaning and mopping mechanisms.
- **Automated Cleaning:** The vacuum cleaner is equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and automatically adjust its path to avoid collisions. It also incorporates a pumping mechanism for efficiently cleaning the floors.
- **Servo Motor Control:** The system includes a servo motor that can be adjusted to sweep across a defined range, enabling precise sensor-based navigation.

## Components
- **Servo Motor:** Used to control the sweeping action and orientation of the robotic vacuum cleaner.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Enables the detection of obstacles and measurement of distances for autonomous navigation.
- **Motor Control:** Utilizes H-bridge motor drivers to control the movement of the robotic vacuum cleaner in different directions.
- **Vacuum & Mopping Mechanism:** Integrated components for cleaning and mopping functions.
- **Pump:** Used for effective floor cleaning by dispensing water or cleaning solution.

## Usage
1. **Smartphone Control:** Users can send commands from a connected smartphone to control the movement and operations of the robotic vacuum cleaner, including navigation, cleaning, and mopping.
2. **Automated Cleaning:** The vacuum cleaner autonomously adjusts its path to avoid obstacles and effectively clean the floors. The pumping mechanism can be activated for enhanced cleaning.
3. **Servo Motor Control:** The servo motor allows for precise sweeping action, which aids in obstacle detection and navigation.

## Getting Started
To replicate this project, you will need an Arduino board, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, DC motors, H-bridge motor drivers, and the necessary mechanical components for the vacuum and mopping mechanisms.
